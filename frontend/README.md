# My Awesome Project

## Changes I Should Make

* Use the addFeatureImage like syntax because it is better and also check theh reason on https://chat.deepseek.com/a/chat/s/e51f085b-a418-4843-a495-4aa05b6e9e26

* reomove the fetchData utility function and write code without it 
* Maintains the structure of the CartItems that aligns best to your project
*  React Hook Form's internal state management and Redux (updateFormData)

* "start": "node .next/standalone/server.js" = Use this when you are following this 
```javascript
// next.config.js
const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';

module.exports = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  output: isProd ? 'standalone' : undefined,
};
```
We use the standalone only in the  production only not ever in the development

* Remove the loginFormControl if it is not in used keep in mind that so it generates the dynamic form building and handle
it cautiously so that it wwould not break your code 



## Authentication Feature

This section describes the implementation of the registration and login features, specifically addressing how the Redux code interacts with the backend API response.

### API Response Structure

Both the registration (`/api/register`) and login (`/api/login`) API endpoints are expected to return a JSON response with the following structure upon successful requests:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Logged in successfully" (or "Registration successful"),
  "user": {
    "id": "67b97014d7c2aa5165bfc9d6",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "role": "seller",
    "userName": "user123"
  }
}
```

I am getting the error that i will going to resolve. The error is in the result.success

```javascript
const YourRegistrationComponent = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const router = useRouter();
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    userName: '',
    email: '',
    password: '',
    confirmPassword: '',
  });

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    try {
      const resultAction = await dispatch(
        registerUser({
          userName: formData.userName,
          email: formData.email,
          password: formData.password,
          confirmPassword: formData.confirmPassword,
        })
      );
      const result = unwrapResult(resultAction);

      if (result.success) {
        toast.success(result.message || "Registration successful!");

        // Redirect to login with success state
        router.push({
          pathname: "/auth/login",
          query: { registered: "true" },
        });
      } else {
        toast.error(result.message || "Registration failed.");
      }
    } catch (error) {
      // The error here will be the value returned by rejectWithValue in the thunk
      toast.error(error);
    }
  };

  // ... rest of your component (form handling, etc.)
};

export default YourRegistrationComponent;
```
#  TODO 
* read the last prompt and understand it of the deepseek related to regiter form of glasses gmail

*You madde the CheckAuth utility function in the    lib/auth/authUtlis    in it you are using the custom errror class 
implement this error class to all the routes: what it will do ? If you try to access the resourse without login than 
redirect the user to login page first after the login than redirect user to the resource
